<br>

I am a __Postdoctoral Researcher__ at Montpellier Business School, France.

My research delves into the economic behavior of individuals in the fields of:
* Sustainable Finance
* Risk Perception
* Intertemporal Choice
* Asset Pricing

Our study "Consequences of Narrow Framing for Risk-Taking: A Stress Test of Myopic Loss Aversion" (with R. Schwaiger und S. Zeisberger) is forthcoming in __Management Science__!

Under [Teaching](https://markusstrucks.github.io//teaching/), you can find more information about my experience in course coordination, lecturing and supervision.

<!--- As a behavioral economist I have a passion for the psychology of risky choice. My research delves into the intricate ties between individual risk perceptions and investment behaviors, spanning both short and long-term horizons. Consider this scenario: Faced with an upcoming salary bonus, do we splurge on a skiing trip or contribute to our retirement savings? Such decisions hinge on a myriad of factors, which I explore in my research. --->
